# Peter_Answers_Clone
A clone of "peteranswers.com"

This is a fortune site guesses the userâ€™s answer. However, there is a trick. In the petition input area, when the user presses ".", the game is activated. It means you actually write your answer to the input area but it masked with another message saying "Peter please answer the following question".  If the user doesn't know how to use the app and solely writes the petition and the question, a generic fortune from an API is shown to the user. There are few additions from the original site. The user can tweet its fortune. The quote area was static in the original website but in this edition quote area is integreated with an API too. The user can also tweet the quote. 

Considering this was my first big personal project and the sixth month of my journey, I am happy with how this project turned out. I also added some extra functionality like generating random quotes from an API. You can tweet your quote. 
Please visit the site for an actual experience.
